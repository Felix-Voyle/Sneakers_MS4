## Design

### Colour Scheme
For the colour scheme I went with a main colour theme of #FF875C which is a slightly paler colour of coral. I also used #81000f a deep red colour which compliments the coral nicely and helps it really stand out. For the rest of the site I used whitesmoke and a range of grey to #222 which all go well with the main theme of coral.


### Typography

I used Oswald for headings as it is stylish and attention-grabbing in bold. The general text for the site is Rubik light which is easily readable and I fell compliments the Oswald style well.

  

### Imagery

Imagery for the homepage I used a range of six images. Three were for smaller mobile screens and therefore worked better as vertical images and three were wider horizontal images which work perfectly on larger screens. I used a dark transparent overlay to sit above these so that the callout text and "shop now" button really stood out. I feel these images instantly highlight the purpose of the site and let the user immediately know what the site is offering.

## Features

### Features to implement in the future

-   A market place where users could buy and sell their own trainers.

- Ideally I should be making sure that a user has actually purchased an item before allowing them to review it. I haven't managed to implement this as I ran out of time but think it would make the reviewing system much more accurate given the time.
To do this I would probably link Orderlineitems to the User rather than or as well as UserProfile which would make them more readily available than needing a UserProfile instance.
