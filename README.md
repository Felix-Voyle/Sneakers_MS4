## Design

### Colour Scheme
I plan to use the following colours;
 - cream
 - coral
 - charcoal


### Typography

I plan to use Oswald for headings as it is stylish and attention-grabbing in bold. The general text for the site i plan to use Rubik light which is easily readable and I fell compliments the Oswald style well.

  

### Imagery

I will use a big attention grabbing image on the main/home page that highlights the site's offering.
